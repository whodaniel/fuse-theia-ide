## 🆕 New Features in SkIDEancer Core 1.67

terminals within a single view.

### 2. Improved AI Onboarding Experience

**What's New:** First-time users now get helpful welcome screens guiding setup.

**States Covered:**

- When AI features are disabled
- When language models aren't configured
- When no default agent is selected

**Benefits:**

- Clear guidance on missing API keys
- Quick recommendations for agents like "SkIDEancer Coder"
- No more confusing automatic Orchestrator delegation

### 3. Claude Code Session Forking

**What's New:** Automatic session forking when editing previous requests in
conversations.

**How It Works:**

1. You're in a chat with Claude
2. You edit a previous message
3. SkIDEancer automatically creates a fork (new branch)
4. Original conversation is preserved

**Use Case:** Try multiple approaches without losing context of initial
attempts.
